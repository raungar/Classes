## STAT200: Introduction to Statistical Inference (Winter 2020)
"Modern statistical concepts and procedures derived from a mathematical framework. Statistical inference, decision theory; point and interval estimation, tests of hypotheses; Neyman-Pearson theory. Bayesian analysis; maximum likelihood, large sample theory. It is aimed at Masters level students in statistics, advanced undergraduates, and Doctoral students in sciences, engineering and other programs. Building on knowledge of probability and calculus, the emphasis is in the formalization of statistical procedures, rather than introducing a menu of possible techniques or practical challenges of data analysis."
